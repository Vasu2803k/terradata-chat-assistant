Abstract
This thesis focuses on health stages division and determining failure occurrence time prediction
are two important parts of the safety study of rolling element bearings. In this thesis, the Hidden
Markov Model (HMM) is used to divide the degradation stages of rolling element bearings.
Given the success of HMMs with these applications, in particular with speech recognition that
has a lot of similarity to machine diagnostics, there is great hope that they will be equally
effective in diagnostic applications. Two side benefits are the existence of computationally
efficient methods for system identification and computing of likelihoods using HMMs. Firstly,
we extract the root mean square feature from the original vibration signal, then utilize the
Viterbi algorithm to divide the degradation stages. Secondly, Fault occurrence time is
determined according to the degradation stage with HMM. In order to verify the effectiveness of
this method, IEE-PHM-2012 challenge data sets are adopted and a comparison with the existing
methods is carried out.

Chapter 1
1 Introduction
In many industrial applications, bearings are critical components that must be monitored and
maintained to ensure reliable operation. One way to achieve this is through condition-based
maintenance (CBM). Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) is a maintenance strategy that
involves using real-time data to make informed decisions about when to perform maintenance
on equipment or machinery. The benefits of CBM include improved equipment reliability,
reduced downtime, and lower maintenance costs. CBM can also help extend the lifespan of
equipment and reduce the risk of catastrophic failure, which can have significant safety and
financial implications. Health state estimation is an important part of CBM, as it provides a way
to predict when maintenance is needed. In this report, we explore the use of the health state
estimation of bearings in CBM. In general, the operational cost of rolling element bearings in
CBM is lower than that of traditional maintenance approaches because CBM allows for early
detection of potential issues and enables maintenance personnel to perform corrective actions
before the damage becomes severe. This can help to prevent unexpected failures, reduce
downtime, and lower the overall cost of maintenance. One of the primary benefits of CBM is
that it can help to extend the lifespan of rolling element bearings. By diagnosing potential issues
early, maintenance personnel can take corrective action to prevent further damage, which can
help to prolong the life of the bearing and reduce the frequency of maintenance activities. This,
in turn, can lead to reduced operational costs over the life of the machine.
Another factor that can impact the operational cost of rolling element bearings in CBM is the
type of CBM techniques and tools used. For example, some CBM techniques, such as vibration
analysis or oil analysis, require specialized equipment and trained personnel, which can increase
the cost of implementation. However, the long-term benefits of CBM can outweigh the initial
costs by reducing maintenance and repair costs and improving overall machine performance.
1

In summary, the operational cost of rolling element bearings in CBM can vary depending on
several factors, but in general, CBM can help to reduce the overall cost of maintenance by
extending the lifespan of the bearing, reducing downtime, and preventing unexpected failures.
While the implementation of CBM may require an initial investment in specialized equipment
and training, the long-term benefits can result in significant cost savings over the life of the
machine.
Rolling element bearings are critical components of many machines, and they are designed to
withstand the loads, speeds, and operating conditions of the machine. However, over time,
rolling element bearings can experience various types of degradation and wear, which can lead
to failure and costly repairs. To mitigate the risk of unexpected failures, maintenance strategies
such as Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) are implemented. CBM is a maintenance
approach that involves monitoring the health of a machine and performing maintenance
activities when needed based on the current condition of the machine. CBM uses various
techniques to monitor the health of machines, including rolling element bearings, such as
vibrational analysis, acoustic emission, and oil analysis.
By monitoring the health of rolling element bearings, maintenance personnel can detect the
onset of degradation and wear and take corrective action before the damage becomes severe.
The division of health degradation of rolling element bearings is an essential aspect of CBM
because it allows maintenance personnel to identify the type and severity of damage present in
the bearing and to take appropriate corrective action to prevent further degradation and potential
failure. There are various types of health degradation that can occur in rolling element bearings,
including
Surface damage: This type of degradation can occur due to poor lubrication, contamination, or
improper installation. Surface damage can cause increased friction, heat, and wear, which can
lead to premature failure.
Fatigue: This type of degradation occurs due to cyclic loading, which can cause microcracks to
form and propagate within the bearing material. Fatigue can lead to spalling, cracking, and
ultimately, bearing failure.
2

Wear: This type of degradation occurs due to the abrasive action of particles or other materials
that come into contact with the bearing. Wear can cause loss of material, which can affect the fit
and function of the bearing.
By understanding the different types of health degradation that can occur in rolling element
bearings, maintenance personnel can use appropriate techniques to detect and diagnose the
specific type of damage present. For example, vibration analysis can detect changes in vibration
levels that may indicate surface damage, while oil analysis can detect the presence of wear
particles or contaminants in the lubricant.

2 Literature Review
It is advantageous to accurately foresee the failure occurrence time of mechanical equipment in
order to increase equipment reliability and decrease the failure rate (Lee et al., 2014). However,
continuous operation of mechanical equipment will result in progressive failure, and in general,
continuous operation of the equipment demonstrates a clear degradation trend (Xiao et al.,
2020). Traditional operation and maintenance methods and concepts are becoming increasingly
inadequate for the equipment's normal operation. Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) is
one of the equipment maintenance techniques that have emerged recently (Liu et al., 2018). In
general, the program for predicting the health of equipment consists of four steps: data
collection, health indicator (HI) construction, health stage division, and RUL prediction (Cheng
et al., 2018). In actuality, it is not necessary to survey the entire life cycle of apparatus for RUL.
Therefore, it is essential to monitor the equipment's condition. (Lei et al., 2018) The equipment
can be divided into two distinct stages and multiple stages based on its various degradation
tendencies. For the division of the health stage, the majority of published works artificially
divide the degradation stage based on the trend change of vibration signal characteristics. (Saidi
et al., 2015) combined EMD with artificial neural networks to classify defects and monitor the
degradation state of full-life bearings. (Soualhi et al., 2013) used the changing trend of RMS as
an index to partition the degradation stage, and then established an empirical threshold by
observing. However, establishing the experience threshold manually is not universal.
Using a method based on reinforcement learning through change, (Soualhi et al., 2013)
proposed the use of points to categorize the health status. However, this approach is optimal for
small samples only. To address the aforementioned issues, this project focuses primarily on
resolving the division of health stages and determining the failure occurrence time. The primary
contributions are categorized as follows: 1) Using the root-mean-square (RMS) of the original
signal as the degraded feature, health stages can be divided and fault occurrence time can be
detected using the Viterbi algorithm; and 2) utilizing actual failure time to calculate evaluation
metrics based on FOT information.

3 Objectives
The objectives of this project are the identification of the deteriorating health states of rolling
element bearings for prognostics and the construction of a Hidden Markov Model for
determining the failure occurrence time.
Figure 1: Bearing and types of faults
3.1 Dataset Description
The PRONOSTIA platform enables run-to-failure performance tests (Bearings degradation:
run-to-failure tests). In order to prevent the spread of damage to the entire testbed (and for
safety reasons), testing was halted when the amplitude of the vibration signal exceeded 20g.
Figure 3 depicts an example of what can be observed on ball-bearing components before and
after an experiment, as well as a vibration unprocessed signal collected over the course of the
experiment.
Note that the deterioration of bearings demonstrates very distinct behaviors, resulting in very
distinct experiment durations (until failure).

4 Methodology and Observations
The HMM approach involves three main steps: data preprocessing, Feature Extraction and
HMM modeling. The first step involves collecting and preprocessing data from sensors attached
to the bearings. This data typically includes vibration signals, temperature readings, and other
information related to bearing health.
The second step is feature extraction which deals with the extraction of the root mean square
which is directly related to the energy content of the vibrational signal. This is done to identify
patterns in the data that are related to specific health states of the bearings. Clustering can be
performed using a variety of algorithms, such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, or
density-based clustering.
The final step is HMM modelling, which involves building a model that describes the
relationship between the observed data and the underlying health states. HMMs are a type of
probabilistic model that can capture the temporal dependencies between observations. In the
case of bearings, HMMs can be used to model the transitions between different health states,
such as normal, early degradation, and severe degradation. In the context of vibration analysis,
RMS (Root Mean Square) values are commonly used to quantify the amplitude of a vibration
signal. The RMS value is the square root of the mean (average) of the squared values of the
signal over a given time period. It provides a measure of the effective or equivalent amplitude of
the vibration signal, taking into account both the positive and negative excursions of the signal.
Vibrational signals can be described using RMS to measure the energy content of the signal.
Let's take the example of a machine vibration signal. When a machine is operating, it generates
a vibration signal that can be measured using sensors. The vibration signal can be analyzed
using various techniques, including RMS. In this case, the RMS value of the vibration signal
indicates the energy content of the signal. The higher the RMS value of the vibration signal, the
greater the energy in the vibration, which could indicate a higher level of machine activity or
stress.
9

For instance, consider a scenario where a machine is vibrating at a constant frequency, but with
different levels of intensity. If we measure the RMS value of the vibration signal over a period
of time, we can determine the energy content level of the signal. If the RMS value is high, it
indicates that the machine is generating a lot of vibration energy and may require maintenance
or adjustment. On the other hand, if the RMS value is low, it indicates that the machine is
operating normally, and the vibration levels are within acceptable limits.
The distribution of the data collected over time and the root mean square vs the number of
samples are listed below:
4.1 Bearings distributions

(d)RMS vs Number of samples(bearing-4)
Figure 8: Illustration of the combined distribution of RMS vs Number of samples
13

The above graph represents the degradation of health states from the infancy stage to ultimate
failure. RMS value becomes zero at its ultimate failure point where the bearings cannot perform
their required function. This plot provides a basic idea of clustering the dataset into different
clusters with different RMS values which are then fed to the Hidden Markov Model to determine
the current health state of the given bearing provided the data.
4.3 Clustering of the vibrational data using K-Means Clustering
We applied the k-means clustering algorithm to the selected features of the vibrational data. The
optimal value of K was determined using the elbow method, which showed that the data can be
effectively clustered into three groups. The k-means clustering algorithm was then applied to the
data, and the resulting clusters were analyzed. (WCSS – Within Cluster Sum of Squares)
Figure 9: The Elbow Method (WCSS vs Number of clusters)
The optimal value of k turned out to be 3 for our vibrational data applied to the root mean square
values of all bearings. The resulting clusters were analyzed to identify any patterns or anomalies.
Cluster 3 had a high amplitude and low frequency, which may indicate a potential issue with the
rolling element bearing. Cluster 2 had a high amplitude and high frequency, which may indicate
normal bearing behavior. Cluster 1 had a low amplitude and high frequency, which may indicate
the presence of noise or interference in the data.
14

We applied the k-means clustering algorithm to vibrational data collected from rolling element
bearings and showed its effectiveness in detecting potential issues or anomalies in the data. The
resulting clusters were analyzed to identify any patterns, which can help maintenance personnel
to take proactive maintenance actions to prevent unexpected failures and downtime.
The below graphs illustrate the clustering or division of health stages of each bearing:
Figure 10: (a) Health stages division using K-means Clustering (bearing-1)
15

(b) Health stages division using K-means Clustering (bearing-2) (c) Health stages division using
K-means Clustering (bearing-3)
(d) Health stages division using K-means Clustering (bearing-4)
From the above graph, it is evident that Cluster 1 is a state of good health, cluster 3 is a state of
degraded health and Cluster 2 is a state of failure. However, K-Means clustering doesn’t provide
accurate results due to its limitations. The limitations of K-Means clustering include the
dependence on the initial choice of centroids, sensitivity to outliers, cannot handle non-linear
boundaries, and assuming spherical clusters.
Therefore, it is important to choose another approach that can classify the different health stages.
So, this thesis helps in comparing the K-means clustering model and the proposed approach
clustering using Hidden Markov Model.
16

4.4 Construction of HMM and Characterization of health states
Basically, this model comes from the idea that observations are made at each state but the true
state is hidden (Health states) and it must be inferred from observations (Vibrational signals).
HMM involves the estimation of different parameters:
1. Starting probabilities
(i) = P(q(1) = i) ⇒ (q(t) is the state at time t)
2. Transition probabilities
A(i,j) = P(q(t+1) = j | q(t) = i) ⇒ where q(t) is the state at time t
3. Emission probabilities
B(j,k) = P(O(t) = k | q(t) = j) ⇒ where k is the value of the observation.
Estimation of the combination of these parameters is done to get a trained Hidden Markov
Model. λ= (𝛑, A, B) gives the combination of these parameters
L(λ|O)= f(λ|O) (Observations are denoted by O)
= P(λ|O)
= (P(O|λ)*P(λ))/P(O) (Bayes theorem)
P(O|λ) needs to be maximized to get the optimal sequence of hidden states
We use a Forward-Backward algorithm (Viterbi) to identify the sequence with the highest
probability using the backtracking technique.
The Hidden Markov Model offers three modelling approaches:
1. Using only the observed data, determine the model parameters.
2. Estimate the optimal sequence of hidden states given the model's parameters and the observed
data.
3. Calculate the likelihood of the model given the model's parameters and observed data.
17

Viterbi algorithm
The Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that is used to find the most likely
sequence of hidden states in a hidden Markov model (HMM). The algorithm was first proposed
by Andrew Viterbi in 1967 and has since become a widely used algorithm in various fields,
including speech recognition, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.
The Viterbi algorithm uses a recursive approach to compute the most likely sequence of hidden
states in an HMM. The algorithm works by maintaining a table of probabilities for each possible
state at each time step, and then iteratively computing the most likely sequence of hidden states
by considering the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another.
Initialization: At the first-time step t=1, the probability of being in each possible state i is given
by the initial state probabilities, denoted by π(i).
Viterbi Algorithm Formula:
δ(1, i) = π(i) * b_i(o1)
where δ(1, i) represents the probability of being in state i at time t=1, and b_i(o1) represents the
probability of observing the first output symbol o1 given that the system is in state i.
Recursion: For each subsequent time step t=2 to T, the probability of being in each possible state
i is calculated by considering the probability of transitioning from the previous state j to state i,
multiplied by the probability of observing the current output symbol given that the system is in
state i.
Viterbi Algorithm Formula:
δ(t, i) = max(δ(t-1,j) * a_ji * b_i(ot)) for all j where δ(t, i) represents the
probability of being in state i at time t, a_ji represents the probability of transitioning from state j
to state i, and b_i(ot) represents the probability of observing the current output symbol ot given
that the system is in state i.
The max operator in the above formula is used to choose the state j that maximizes the
probability of transitioning from state j to state i at time t.
18

Termination: Once the final time step T has been reached, the most likely sequence of hidden
states is obtained by backtracking the probabilities to find the sequence of states that maximizes
the overall probability.
Viterbi Algorithm Formula:
s(T) = argmax(δ(T, i)) for all i where s(T) represents the most likely state at time T.
By using the Viterbi algorithm, it is possible to efficiently compute the most likely sequence of
hidden states in an HMM, making it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications. From the
figures listed above, we can find that the degradation trends of Bearing 1 and Bearing 3 are
relatively close while Bearing 2 and Bearing 4 are both in a rapid degradation situation, and the
remaining three bearings are in the slow degradation stage.
Once the feature vector has been extracted, it can be used as an input to train the HMM model.
The initial values of A do not affect the initialization of model parameters. It would not impact
the final result, so we can randomly initialize. However, the choice of the initial value for B
significantly impacts the calculation result. This study uses the mixed Gaussian distribution as
the observation probability density function, and its number is set to four. In general, the number
of states is directly divided or clustered, and then the corresponding distribution is computed
because of initialization. Utilizing the K-means clustering method for initialization is one of the
more effective approaches.
Following parameter initialization, the maximum number of iteration steps is set to 50. Given the
present observation sequence and the completion of training, the current observation sequence
can be divided into health stages.
We have used “hmmlearn” library developed in Python which is a free source toolkit for working
with Hidden Markov models. We can easily download the toolkit using pip which is a package
manager for Python.
19

The code snippet is as follows.
!pip install hmmlearn
from hmmlearn import hmm
# Given the observed data, estimation of model parameters # Guassian mixture emissions
from hmmlearn import hmm
# Initializing HMM
hmm_model=hmm.GMMHMM(n_components=3, n_mix=4, n_iter=50, random_state=42,
tol=0.0001)
Hmm_model1
Training of the initialized Hidden Markov Model is done with the help of bearing 1 and bearing
2.
hmm_model.fit(b11_rms. reshape (-1,1))
hmm_model.fit(b12_rms. reshape (-1,1)), where b11_rms and b12_rms are the root mean
square values of the vibrational signal samples collected over time.
After the completion of the training, we can use “hmm_model” for prediction and the predicted
values are used to classify the observations of testing bearings or the remaining bearings to
determine the different health stages and fault occurrence time.
20

The graphs given below represent the classification of different health stages of 4 bearings using
the Hidden Markov Model:
Figure 11: (a) Health stages division using HMM of bearing-1
Here, note that Cluster 1 represents the good health stage, Cluster 3 represents the degradation
stage, and Cluster 2 - is the failure Stage.
21

(b) Health stages division using HMM of bearing-2
(c) Health stages division using HMM of bearing-3
22

(d) Health stages division using HMM of bearing-4
It is not difficult to see from the above figures that the method proposed for the four bearings
succeeded to detect the FOT of bearings. The remaining bearings have been fully tested.
Bearings 1 and 4 are more accurate than the other methods, which shows the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Furthermore, the degradation stage division and FOT detection results are
given under different working conditions in the below table. It shows that this method can
effectively divide the health stage of the bearing and seize the FOT. From the graph, it is evident
that Cluster 1 represents a state of good health, cluster 3 represents a state of degradation, and
Cluster 2 represents a state of failure. Therefore, HMM model provides better results when
compared to other methods.

Method 1 was used in the research paper published by (Li et al., 2019) and Method 2 was used in
the research paper published by (Zhu et al., 2020). Our thesis is mainly focused on improving the
determination of fault occurrence time and division of health stages using the Hidden Markov
Model. The papers mentioned in the literature review dealt with the determination of FOT and
remaining useful life which failed to divide or classify the different health stages. Fortunately,
our thesis has improved the performance in the determination of FOT and succeeded in dividing
the health stages.

From the above tables, it is evident that the Fault Occurrence Time of the 4 bearings is closer to
the Failure Time which shows that the Hidden Markov Model is performing better than other
models employed in various research papers. It is significantly important to predict the FOT To
predict the remaining useful life (RUL) for the bearings. To predict RUL, we do specify the
lower boundary and upper boundary to represent the failure occurrence time which should be
generalized to all the rolling element bearings. Therefore, the FOT should be closer to the
failure time of the bearing which would fall in the range of the boundaries specified.

5. Conclusion
In this thesis, the Hidden Markov Model is used for the division of degradation stages, and
determining the fault occurrence time. The Viterbi algorithm is used to divide the degradation
stages and obtain the FOT. Once the FOT is obtained, the performance of the model is
evaluated. Experiments show that this method can effectively obtain the bearing degradation
stage and detect the FOT. Based on the comparison with other models in determining fault
occurrence time and health stages division, it can be concluded that the hidden Markov model
has performed well. This indicates that your model has successfully captured the underlying
patterns in the data and produced reliable results. However, further validation and testing of the
model on a larger dataset may be necessary to fully establish its performance and
generalizability. Overall, the success of this hidden Markov model in this application
demonstrates its potential as a valuable tool in fault diagnosis and prognosis.
In conclusion, HMMs are a promising approach for the health state estimation of bearings in
CBM. By combining classical clustering techniques and HMM modeling, this approach can
effectively capture the complex temporal dependencies in bearing data and provide accurate
predictions of health states. As such, HMMs have the potential to improve the reliability and
efficiency of industrial machinery, while reducing maintenance costs and downtime.
