Chapter 1
Introduction
Permanent changes in the money supply have no long-term effects on real variables, according to
mainstream classical economics. Therefore, real output, unemployment rates, and real prices will not
be impacted by an independent increase in the money supply; consequently, real income and the real
price of goods will not change. Instead, all prices and wages will rise proportionately.
The degree of employment is mostly determined by long-term real factors such as population growth,
technology, economic agents' preferences, and specific elements of the institutional framework of the
economic system (such as property rights, taxation, and welfare policy). As a result, we can conclude
that although central banks have the authority to control the money supply and make market
interventions when needed. They are unable to eventually affect the real economy by printing more or
less money. A shift in the money supply will probably affect variables right away because of price
stickiness and insufficient flow of market information.Furthermore, even in the short term, real
economic activity remains unaffected by a perfectly anticipated monetary policy, according to certain
neoclassical economists. Ekomie (2013). Thus, it is essential to comprehend how the idea of monetary
neutrality can assess the efficacy of monetary policies in any nation's economy.
Monetary neutrality, a fundamental concept in classical economics, asserts that changes in the money
supply only affect nominal variables—like wages and prices—over the long run, leaving real
variables—like output and employment—unaffected. This theory states that adjustments to the money
supply will only result in commensurate adjustments to prices and wages; it will not impact the
economy's total production potential.
In order to assess monetary policies' efficacy in the context of monetary neutrality, economists closely
examine the ways in which shifts in the money supply impact different economic variables over
varying time spans. Short-term changes in the money supply can have a transient impact on actual
economic activity because of things like imperfect market information transmission and price
stickiness. For example, an unexpected rise in the money supply could initially encourage investment
and spending, resulting in a brief increase in output and employment.

Chapter 2
Objective of the Study
High inflation reduces the purchasing power of money and creates uncertainty in the economy, which
has a negative impact on the standard of living as well as the macro economy as a whole. As a result,
the majority of central banks worldwide now consider attaining price stability—generally understood
to mean low and stable inflation—to be the main goal of monetary policy. Therefore, it is crucial to
comprehend how much inflationary pressure is produced when the money supply is used as a tool for
policy. As a result, the study's goal can be split into these three sections:
1. To research the extent of money neutrality in India and the best ways for policymakers to
employ it to maintain price stability.
2. To determine the effects of any changes in the money supply, both direct and indirect, on
actual factors including unemployment, investment, and inflation.
3. To comprehend the drawbacks of ideas such as the quantity theory of money and how to get
around them.

Literature Review
3.1 Research Gap
The majority of the research in this field uses US data, and there appears to be a bias in the discussion
in favor of the US. Even though theoretical research and data are available, other nations, like the G20
countries, perceive a deficiency in the empirical research conducted in this area. One observes that,
even in the absence of multivariate systems, real output has received the majority of attention in the
survey, while the long-term bivariate relationship between money or inflation and other significant
real variables has received less attention. Just conducting a more thorough investigation of the
long-term bivariate relationships for variables other than real output would accomplish a great deal
more. Another problem is that, in evaluating neutrality propositions, every analysis surveyed looks at
a single nation at a time. It would be interesting to find out if a panel approach were used for a
collection of comparable nations, such as the G7, and if the results would match those reported in the
studies or if significant interactions between the nations are being overlooked. Examine multivariate
systems for a single nation that incorporate an international variable in an effort to account for
cross-border effects. Additionally, a statistical mean of an economy's pricesserves as the general price
level in empirical models. As a result, evaluating shifts in the relative price structure, if they occur,
and their implications for resource allocation are challenging. Furthermore, when testing neutrality
propositions, the traditional method of examining one nation at a time may miss important economic
interactions. The application of a panel approach could yield valuable insights into the generalizability
of findings from single-country studies, as well as whether important cross-border interactions are
being overlooked.

3.2 Theoretical and Empirical Literature
Theoretical Literature: Many studies have been conducted to support the classical view, which holds
that money is not neutral over the short or long term. It begins with criticisms of the classical view
and then uses empirical techniques to demonstrate how changes in the amount of money in circulation
within an economy affect output, unemployment, relative prices, and other real variables. (Oliver,
1997).

Before completely impacting prices, sticky prices from changes in money stock can have an impact
on output. Real wages and real prices fluctuate as a result of lags in nominal wages, which modify the
incentives for employment and output. Furthermore, they linked the fixity of some nominal
contractual costs—whose real burden increased or decreased in response to inflation or deflation—to
the non-neutrality of money. Real rates changed as a result of the nominal interest rate lag behind
inflation, which had an impact on real activity, capital investment, and business
borrowing.Non-neutrality was also found to be caused by desired fixed inventory-to-sales ratios,
which increased production for inventory in response to money-induced increases in sales. The
classicals also connected non-neutrality to an incorrect belief that output is required in response to
monetary shocks because of a mix-up between changes in relative and general prices.
Additionally, according to the classicals, money affects business confidence, which in turn affects
output. They also discussed how money-induced increases in aggregate demand boost productivity
and encourage specialization and the division of labor by growing the market for goods. Some
classical scholars even contended that the output effects of money result from the increased work
required to maintain a constant real income in the face of inflation.
According to the quantity theory of money, when there is a real shock to relative prices, other prices
adjust to compensate, but absolute prices stay at the same level. The money supply, money velocity,
and volume of goods transactions are the causes of this. The authors of [Marinko et al. 2016] do not
support these theories and offer proof that the additional funds generated by commercial banks or the
central bank are initially applied to specific products and services. When compared to other products,
these products become more in demand, which drives up their prices. As more money enters the
economy, there will be a greater demand for other goods, which will drive up prices. Wealth and
income are redistributed in favor of those who received the new currency early in the process, at the
expense of those who received it later. As such, there are two types of relative price changes. The first
is the redistribution of income from late to early recipients of the new money that occurs during the
inflationary process.The second is the continuous, irreversible changes in wealth and income that
occur even after the money has been distributed across the economy. This gradual redistribution of
wealth and income shows how money is ultimately non-neutral. Quarterly time-series data covering
the US economy from 1959 to 2013 are used in this analysis.

In his paper [7], James Bullard examines more recent methods in the literature to verify the money's
neutrality. The paper addresses the following question: "What would happen if the money stock, for
example, was $5 billion one day and had been $5 billion for a long time? How would it change
suddenly to $6 billion and stay there for a long time?"This experiment is a one-of-a-kind long-term,
unforeseen shift in the money stock's level. He also discusses the concept of super-neutrality of
money, which essentially states that if the government initially keeps the money stock growing at a
particular rate for an extended length of time and at some date, that growth rate is abruptly changed to
a different rate. This paper concludes an extensive survey regarding the long-term and super-neutrality
of money for the industrialized economy. It also notes that all of the analyses in the survey examine
one country at a time when testing neutrality propositions. Additional research can be conducted to
determine whether a panel approach, applied to a group of comparable nations such as the G7, would
yield outcomes similar to those documented in the surveyed studies or if significant interactions
among the nations are being overlooked.
There are a few studies on the neutrality of money that consider the interaction of variable 1 in
particular nations, such as [8, 9, 10]. The majority of economists seem to concur these days that
monetary policy affects real variables in some way, even though the precise mechanism underlying
this relationship is up for discussion. Several convincing explanations have been proposed in recent
years.Regarding the subject of money's non-neutrality, more investigation will be required before any
conclusions are drawn.

Empirical Literature: One of the core ideas of QTM is the contrast between relative and absolute
prices. This paradox has to do with the idea that although changes in relative prices are caused by
changes in real variables, changes in absolute prices are attributed to monetary factors. Put another
way, given the quantity, velocity, and volume of goods exchanged, changes brought about by a real
shock to relative prices result in compensating adjustments in other prices, which keep the level of
absolute prices unchanged. The authors of [Kuek et al. 2016] also conclude that independent changes
in the money supply had an effect on real output levels over time, regardless of the monetary
aggregate we choose to include in the analysis. It implies that the shift in the money supply cannot be
explained solely by monetary factors, and as a result, the countries under observation have the
monetary policy contingency to control actual economic activity. The empirical study is based on
panel cointegration analysis, which makes use of real output annual data and broad (M2) and narrow
(MI) monetary aggregates for 11 former socialist EU countries from 1995 to 2013.
The authors of [Marinko et al. 2016] discovered empirical evidence that money is not neutral in the
non-traditional sense. This is because during a transitional period—which lasts until the price level
fully adjusts in a new steady-state equilibrium—changes in the money supply disturb relative prices
and, consequently, the distribution of resources within the economy.

Chapter 4
Methodology and Source of Data
4.1 Analytical Framework and Model
According to empirical data, money is not neutral in the non-traditional sense since shifts in the
money supply have an impact on relative prices, which then have an impact on the distribution of
resources within the economy. Two regression systems are built by us. In the first, changes in the
money supply are linked to changes in relative prices; in the second, changes in the money supply and
relative prices are influenced by the rate of inflation in addition to certain real factors.
We estimate the first equation as:
Δ(Pi/ Pj ) = β 0 + i ∑n α i Δ(Pi/ Pj)t-I + β 1 ΔMt + β 2 ΔYt + vt -----------------------(1)
where (Pi/Pj)t indicates the change in relative prices, Mt is the change in the money supply, Yt is the
change in the real GDP, and n is the number of lags of the dependent variable.
The fundamental idea behind this equation is that variations in the quantity of money in circulation
and variations in real output—the real sector of the economy that is represented in Eq. (1)—cause
variations in relative prices. A shift in these factors leads to a shift in the money supply, which affects
relative prices that are determined by other factors like the interest rate.
The second equation of the system is:
Vt = δ 0 + i ∑nγ iVt-I + δ 1 Δ(Pi/Pj)t + δ 2 ΔMt + ut ----------------------- (2)

In this instance, the natural rate of unemployment (U), the variation of real investment (I), and the
inflation rate (n) are the variables that are used to represent the dependent variable V. We evaluate the
indirect effects of the money supply change on the real variables and the inflation rate through relative
prices, to the extent necessary to fit this rate. This time, the money rate determines the money supply.
However, the target of the funds rate can be any of the dependent variables in Eq (2). In a later
section, we will discuss the appropriated econometric methodology we employ to address
endogeneity.
The system composed of Eqs. (1) and (2) is subject to several endogeneity sources. The variable M I,
or the change in the money supply, is determined endogenously by at least three factors. Changes in
the quantity of money in circulation first affect the relative price, but it can also affect how the
monetary authority targets monetary aggregates. Second, we use M2 to represent the money supply
even though there are other metrics. It is impossible to ascertain, nevertheless, which monetary
aggregates the Fed is genuinely attempting to control. It could therefore be considered a typical
example of variable error.Finally, when the funds-rate is the target of the operational regime, the
amount of money is the variable that changes to the extent necessary to fit this rate. Here, the money
supply is regulated by the funds rate. However, the federal funds rate can target any of the factors that
are dependent on Eq (2). We describe the appropriate econometric strategy we employ to manage
endogeneity in the section that follows.
4.2 Data
The 41 observations that make up the study's data set span the quarter-to-quarter period from March
2011 to March 2021. The variables taken into account are: P /Pi: The relative price is determined by
dividing the WPI by the CPI (Consumer Price Index).
(Wholesale Price Index), the money supply M2, real GDP (RGDP), and the quarterly inflation rate
(n), in that order. Real investment is expressed as the sum of all completed investments, and U stands
for the quarterly unemployment rate.
The evolution of these variables over time is depicted in figures 1 to 6.

Figure 1: Relative price change as the Dependent variable, Mar 2011—Mar 2021
Figure 2: Change in Money Supply (M2), Mar 2011—Mar 2021.

Figure 3: Change in Real output given by Real GDP, Mar 2011—Mar 2021.

Figure 5: Real Investment given by Projects value completed, Mar 2011—Mar 2021
Figure 6: Unemployment Rate, Mar 2011—Mar 2021

We chose the ratio of the Consumer Price Index to the Wholesale Price Index as our dependent
variable in order to address the problem of average pricing.As previously noted in the research gap,
the majority of studies employ statistical averages of prices, which makes it challenging to evaluate
potential shifts in the relative price structure and the implications for allocating resources based on
this idea.
In addition, we use M2 as the money supply variable rather than Ml since it displays a wider range of
currency exchange methods. Furthermore, we consider the value of finished projects in India when
making real investments.
The Ministry of Statistics, Program Implementation, and Press Information Bureau are the sources of
the data. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, the Central Statistics Office, and
the Reserve Bank of India provide the data for the independent variables.
4.3 Possible Outcome
To find out if shifts in the money supply affect output and other real variables, I first studied the
matter using the most basic version of the quantity theory of money.. The end outcome there
demonstrated that money is not neutral. Here, too, we anticipate that the relative price and other real
variables will be impacted by the shift in the money supply. We can see from the literature review that
economists hold the view that money is not neutral. They argue that real variables are affected by
changes in the money supply. Two primary conclusions are anticipated from our analysis.
One is that changes in the money supply (M2) will impact the relative prices (CPI/WPI) in one of two
ways: either positively or negatively, depending on how the money is supplied to the economy. Since
it takes time for newly infused funds to reach consumers, we can generally assume that an increase in
WP I will occur before a rise in CPI. In a similar vein, we anticipate that the lag variable reflecting the
change in relative price will have a negative relationship with the dependent variable. This is because
any significant change in relative price during any given period will have a negative effect on the
subsequent or upcoming period.

Observing the indirect effect of change in money supply on real variables, we expect large
coefficients of change in relative prices in Eq. 2. There should be a positive correlation between
changes in relative prices and the inflation rate since higher price fluctuations lead to higher inflation.
Even though prices do not rise proportionately, investments should increase as the amount of money
in the economy does. Since more money in the market should lead to businesses hiring more workers
to meet the growing demand, the unemployment rate should be negatively correlated with changes in
relative prices.
When examining the outcomes of Equation 2, we must bear in mind that the ultimate impact of
alterations in the money supply on the real variable will be conveyed via a blend of direct and indirect
effects, resulting from modifications in the money supply and the relative price.

Findings and Implications
5.1 Findings and Discussions
The econometric findings of the estimated model produced by Eqs. (1) and (2) are shown in this
section. We used estimates derived from the generalized method of moments (GM M) for that. Table 2
shows the regression based on Equation 1. At a 5% confidence level, the outcome demonstrates the
significance of the model as a whole. When the lags are introduced, the findings demonstrate that the
relative prices and the change in the money supply both exhibit negative signs for each of them.
While the coefficient of change in real output is not significant at the level, the second lag variable
and the change in the money supply are both statistically significant at the 10% confidence level. A
10% confidence level indicates that the model as a whole is significant. The empirical results show
that nominal variables, such as the percentage change in the money supply, affect relative prices in
addition to real variables, such as the real GDP percentage change.

actual output is analyzed.

This section displays the econometric results of the estimated model, which is defined by Equations
(1) and (2). We estimated that using the generalized method of moments (GMM). Table 2 shows the
regression based on Equation 1. The outcome demonstrates that the entire model is noteworthy with a
5% degree of confidence. When the lags are introduced, the findings demonstrate that the relative
prices and the change in the money supply both exhibit negative signs for each of them. While the
coefficient of change in real output is not significant at the level, the second lag variable and the
change in the money supply are both statistically significant at the 10% confidence level. A 10%
confidence level indicates that the model as a whole is significant. The empirical results show that
nominal variables, such as the percentage change in the money supply, affect relative prices in
addition to real variables, such as the real GDP percentage change.

The inflation rate changes first when we examine the second equation. Even at the 1% confidence
level, the model is significant with an R-square of 77%. The first dependent variable has a positive
coefficient, indicating its significance. Nonetheless, the coefficients of the change in the money
supply and relative prices are not significant at a 10% confidence level.

At a 5% confidence level, the model is significant in relation to actual investment. At a confidence
level of even 10%, the lag variables show no statistically significant differences.On the other hand, the
relative price shows a negative but statistically insignificant change in coefficient of change, while the
money supply shows a positive and significant change even at the 1% confidence level.

The estimated effect of the percentage change in relative prices on the natural unemployment rate is
negative and significant, whereas the coefficient of change in the money supply is positive but
insignificant. Both the first lag variable and the entire model are significant.
5.2 Conclusion
The majority of the results match our expectations when we compare them to our discussion of
potential outcomes. The change in relative prices was significantly and negatively impacted by the
change in the money supply. The change in money supply had the expected direct effect, despite some
irregularities in the coefficient of change in relative price when viewed in the context of real variables.
-The findings indicate that a 1% increase in \M will result in a 1.07% increase in real investments.
Overall, the empirical findings demonstrate that relative prices are impacted by changes in the money
supply.
This finding contradicts the notion that variations in real variables—such as shifts in the
unemployment rate or technological shocks—are the only factors causing changes in relative
prices.Furthermore, because changes in relative prices have an indirect effect on real economic
variables like real investment variation, the natural unemployment rate, and real potential output
variation, they also serve as monetary policy transmission mechanisms through their manipulation of
the money supply.

5.3 Implications
Regardless of how money affects relative prices, the majority of economists concur that it is not
neutral in the short term.On the other hand, if money influences relative prices, managing monetary
policy becomes significantly more difficult for policymakers. They will have to keep an eye on how
credit and money are being distributed throughout the whole economy. They will need to map out the
distinct ways that various economic sectors will be impacted. The economy will redistribute income
simply because of changes in relative prices, and this could lead to either a rise or fall in the
concentration of income.
Working with the quantity theory of money also produced the important finding that changes in real
variables lead to changes in relative prices, but changes in absolute prices are attributed to monetary
factors. Put differently, given the money supply, money velocity, and volume of goods transactions,
adjustments brought about by a genuine shock to relative prices result in compensatory measures in
other prices, maintaining the level of absolute prices unaltered.Austrian economists assert that the
newly created funds are initially used to buy specific goods and services when the central bank or
commercial banks expand credit and money supply.These products become more in demand in
relation to other products, which raises their prices in comparison to other prices. The demand for
other goods will rise as the new money permeates the economy, driving up the price of those goods as
well. The redistribution of wealth and income benefits those who obtained the new currency early in
the process, while those who received it later on lose out.As such, there are two types of relative price
changes. The first is the redistribution of income, from late to early recipients of the new money, that
occurs during the inflationary process.The second is the continuous, irreversible changes in wealth
and income that occur even after the money has been distributed across the economy. This long-term
change in the distribution of wealth and income shows how money is ultimately non-neutral.

Summary
6.1 Context and objective of study
Our goal in this research is to evaluate the direct effects of money supply expansion on relative price
changes as well as the indirect effects of changes in the money supply and relative price changes on
other significant variables such as inflation, unemployment, and investment. We compute relative
prices using the ratio of the Consumer Price Index to the Wholesale Price Index in order to remove
the effect of price inertia and only observe changes in relative prices. Using a quarterly database that
covers the Indian economy from 2011:1 to 2021:2, our goal is to investigate the direct impact of
monetary policy on relative prices.We also try to investigate the indirect effects of monetary policy on
long-term variables such as the natural unemployment rate, real investment variation, and the rate of
inflation through changes in relative prices.
Relevantly, our study concludes that money is not neutral in the non-traditional sense because
variations in the money supply impact relative prices and, consequently, the distribution of resources
within the economy. The substantial ramifications of this discovery must be considered in the
monetary policy transmission mechanisms.
6.2 Major Findings
To facilitate summarization, the data can be divided into two sections:
1. How changes in the money supply (M2) affect other real variables and relative prices (Pi/Pj).

2. How other real variables are affected when the relative price (PI/Pi) changes.
Our analysis's first section demonstrates how changes in the money supply have a negative impact on
changes in relative prices (CPI/WPI).Since real investment (I) was positively impacted by changes in
the money supply (M2) as well, it is safe to conclude that money neutrality is ruled out.
In the second section of our study, we examined how changes in relative prices (CPI/WPI) could have
an indirect impact on real variables by affecting the money supply (M2). In this case, the natural
unemployment rate is inversely correlated with relative price, and theory indicates that it also has
indirect effects on other real variables.
6.3 Conclusion
The quantity theory of money states that changes in employment, aggregate output, or any other factor
influencing production costs are the only real factors that can impact changes in relative prices. There
are other real factors that could be in play, such as changes in aggregate output, firm monopoly power,
shortages of specific goods, or union pressure. The empirical results of this study show that changes
in the money supply, in addition to changes in real variables, also cause changes in relative prices. If
monetary policy leads to changes in relative prices, we can assume that it also affects the allocation of
production factors and the goods and services produced, resulting in redistribution of income.
6.4 Policy Implication of the findings
The empirical results of this study show that, in addition to variations in real variables, variations in
the money supply also affect changes in relative prices. If monetary policy leads to changes in relative
prices, we can assume that it also affects the allocation of production factors and the goods and
services produced, resulting in redistribution of income. Our study's important conclusion in this
regard is that money is not neutral in the non-traditional sense since changes in the money supply
have an impact on relative prices, which then have an impact on how resources are distributed within
an economy.

Additionally, there is a significant consequence that needs to be taken into account when discussing
the mechanisms through which monetary policy is transmitted—namely, through adjustments in
relative prices. Policymakers would find it challenging to forecast the effects of real and monetary
shocks on relative prices and, consequently, on the variables of interest, including real output growth,
natural unemployment rate, inflation rate, and real investment variation.
6.5 Contribution of the study
This study evaluated the state of monetary policy in India using quarterly data from 2011 to 2021. We
were able to learn more about the problem of money's non-neutrality, particularly in the context of
India, thanks to this study. The application of monetary policy goes beyond merely managing growth
and containing inflation to understanding how changes in the money supply affect the distribution of
income within an economy.
By more thoroughly examining the long-run bivariate relationships for variables other than real
output, such as inflation, real investments, and unemployment rate, this study also broadens the scope
of empirical research.
An additional benefit of this research was that average prices were not utilized to examine how
changes in the money supply affected the economy. We can see the money supply and, consequently,
the impact of monetary policy on income redistribution by using relative prices.
6.6 Limitations of the study
The endogeneity problem among the variables in the aforementioned model is one of its many flaws.
Relative price is impacted by changes in the money supply before other real variables are impacted.
This has not been considered in this paper.

The relative price to the consumer price is what we have used as the wholesale price index. Instead,
we could have used the producers price index (PPI) to determine who experiences inflationary effects
from money supply increases first. The wholesale price index prevents us from observing that.
In addition, we must examine the data and the current economic climate in order to comprehend this
impact within the context of India. Additionally, the time frame for evaluating the money's
non-neutrality proposition needs to be extended.
6.7 Scope for future research
Both equations could have been used simultaneously by the model to track changes in the money
supply, their impact on prices, and finally the real variable. We could have used the Generalized Mean
Model for this.
We still haven't thought about how monetary policy is impacted by global trade. We could have
considered a second state or used a panel approach, applied to a collection of comparable nations, and
then evaluated its impact on the money's non-neutrality proposition.
If the economy ever experienced a period of time when it did not behave similarly to the other period,
the model is ideal for taking dummy variables into account. We can extend the study's duration to
include two periods in India's context—one before and one after economic liberalization—in order to
examine the structural break.
